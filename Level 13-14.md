## Level 13 - 14

***Aim:*** Obtain the password for the next level, which is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14.

Direct access is restricted, so a provided private SSH key must be used to log in as bandit14.

Action taken:

- Logged into the server as bandit13 and identified the provided private SSH key in the home directory.
- `ls` verified the location of the key file.
- Logged out and copied the private key from the Bandit server to the local machine, since SSH connections from localhost are blocked on the server.

```bash
scp -P 2220 bandit13@bandit.labs.overthewire.org:/home/bandit13/sshkey.private .
```

- `ls` confirmed the key was successfully transferred locally.
- Fixed the key permissions locally, as SSH refuses to use keys that are accessible by others.
  
```bash
chmod 600 sshkey.private
```

Used the private key to authenticate as bandit14 over SSH.

```bash
ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

Once logged in as bandit14, accessed the password file.

```bash
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14
```
***Issues encountered:***

- SSH connections from within the Bandit server (localhost) were blocked, requiring the key to be copied to the local machine first.
- Initial SCP attempts failed due to incorrect remote path syntax.
- SSH rejected the private key until file permissions were restricted to 600.

***Important information learnt:***

- SSH authentication is performed client-side; private keys must exist on the machine initiating the connection.
- SCP remote paths must be specified without spaces and with correct colon placement.
- SSH enforces strict private key permissions and will ignore insecure key files.
- Bandit intentionally blocks SSH chaining to reinforce correct SSH workflow and security practices.
