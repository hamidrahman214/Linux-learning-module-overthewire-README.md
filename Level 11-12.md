## Level 11 - 12
***Aim:*** Find the password from file data.txt, where all lowercase (a-z) and uppercase (A-Z) letters have been rotated by 13 positions

The helpful reading material went through ROT13 which explained the aim, now we needed to translate that into a command

***Action taken:*** 
- used the `ls` command to list the contents
- Seen that the `data.txt` file was in the current working directory
- used the `cat data.txt` command to show the conents of the file
- the file printed `Gur cnffjbeq vf 7k16JArUVv5LxVuJfsSVdbbtaHGlw9D4`
- It was clear that this is the part that needed to be translated, so i ran the cat command followed by the tr command

```bash
cat data.txt | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'
```

***Level 12 Password:*** `7x16WNeHIi5YkIhWsfFIqoognUTyj9Q4`
