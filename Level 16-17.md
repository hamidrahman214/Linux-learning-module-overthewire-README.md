## Level 16-17

***Aim:*** Find the credentials for the next level by submitting the password if the previous level to a port on localhost that has the following properties:

- port number: between 31000 and 32000
- a port that has a server listening on it
- find out which of those speak SSL/TLS and which don’t
- There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.

`nmap` is a network mapper and can be used as a port scanner.

I used `nmap` to search for ports between 31000 and 32000 that were open, this also means that it has a server listening on it and it displayed 5 different ports.

```bash
nmap -p 31000-32000 localhost
```

It printed

```bash
PORT      STATE SERVICE
31046/tcp open  unknown
31518/tcp open  unknown
31691/tcp open  unknown
31790/tcp open  unknown
31960/tcp open  unknown
```

I ran the `openssl` command to find the port we are looking for

```bash
openssl s_client -connect localhost:<port number>
```

- I found that port 31790 responded differently, I inserted the password and it responded with `KEYUPDATE`
- I added `-ign_eof` which means ignore end-of-file on stdin and keep the TLS session open

```bash
openssl s_client -connect localhost:31790 -ign_eof
```

- It printed the private key, i then copied it into a file and named it `sshkey2.private` on my home user directory.
- I changed the file permissions for only the user to read and write using `chmod 600 sshkey2.private`

I then used the `ssh` command to enter level 17.

```bash
ssh -i sshkey2.private bandit17@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```
