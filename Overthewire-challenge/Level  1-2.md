Level 1-2

Aim: Find the password from a file named "-"

Action taken:
- used the ls command to list the contents, the - file was present
- After not being able to list the content using the cat - command as it is read as a stdin, not a file
-  I learnt that ./- forces the shell to read - as a file in the current directory
-  I used the cat ./- command to list the contents in that file

Cat ./-

Level 2 password
