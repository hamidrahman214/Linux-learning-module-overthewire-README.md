## Level 14 - 15

***Aim:*** Find the password by submitting the password obtained in the previous level to port 30000 on localhost.

- The commands that were to be used in this level were `ssh, telnet, nc, openssl, s_client, nmap`

Action taken:

- After reading on the commands and learning about how the internet works, I learnt that i needed to use the `nc` command to send a message to `localhost` on port `30000`.
- I first established a connection to `localhost` on port `30000`
- I inputted the password required

```bash
nc hostname 30000

***Level 15 Password:*** `8xCjnmgoKbGLhHFAZlGE5Tmu4M2tKJQo`
