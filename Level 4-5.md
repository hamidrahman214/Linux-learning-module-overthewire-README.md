## Level 4-5
***Aim:*** Find the password in the only human-readable file in the inhere directory

***Action taken:*** 
- I entered the inhere directory using the command `cd inhere`
- I ran the `ls` command to see the contents of the directory
- After seeing that all files begin with a `-`
- i decided to run the `find ./*` command which displayed the file type of every file in the directory
- `./-file07: ASCII text` was the only file listed as text and this showed that it was the only human readable file
- i then ran the `cat ./-file07` command to list the contents in the file

***Level 4 password:*** `4oQYVPkxZOOEOO5pTW81FB8j8lxXGUQw`
