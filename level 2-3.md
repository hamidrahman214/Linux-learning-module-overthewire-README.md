Level 2-3

Aim: Find the password from a file named --spaces in this filename-- located in the home directory

Action taken: 

- Listed the contents of the home directory using ls and confirmed the file existed
- Since the filename contains spaces, it must be wrapped in quotes
- Because the filename also starts with -, it needs to be referenced as a path to avoid being treated as an option
- Used ./ to explicitly point to the file and read its contents.
```bash
- cat ./"--spaces in this filename--"
```
